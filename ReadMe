This project was a project me and a friend had to do in school.  We did it first in c++ and then in python.  As you can see, this is the c++ version.  The following is the raw information I included in the original README.  Thank you for viewing my code.

In this lab me and Mason have included two separate classes.  An orderclient class and a messaging class.  Each have the purpose of controlling the flow of threads into these delicate data types (a queue, and a map). 

Apart from this, in the server.cc where we keep the main function we created several mutexes and condition_variables that will help regulate both the 'head thread' located in the serve function, and also the worker threads (located at the top of server.cc).

The service is to be run on Linux.
